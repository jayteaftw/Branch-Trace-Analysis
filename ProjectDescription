Project Tasks

Always start by working on short trace,  Download short trace,then work on long traces. Download long traces.

1. Understanding Trace Format and unzipping long traces  Download long traces(one day work)--> 4/12

2. Analysis of traces (0.5 Weeks Work)  --> 4/16
    A. Count percentage of  T/NT branches in trace file.
    B. Count number of distinct branch instructions in trace file. 


For the following task, you need to find the misprediction rate (0<m<1)

3. Evaluating static branch prediction techniques (0.5  week work) --> 4/20
    A. Predict branch always taken
    B. Predict branch always not taken

4. Simple dynamic branch prediction techniques ( 1 week work)  --> 4/27
    A. 1-bit predictor    (10 bits of address)
    B. 2-bit predictor (use saturating counter implementation)   (10 bits of address)
    C. 3-bit predictor  (use saturating counter implementation)   (10 bits of address)

5. More advanced dynamic predictor techniques (1.5  week work) --> 5/7
    A. Correlating predictor (global) (5, 1) predictor with 5 bits of addres (5 bit shift register, 1 prediction bit)
    B. Gshare  (10-bit shift register and 10 bits of address)

6. Custom advanced predictor (selected by group) (2 week work) --> 5/21
    size selected to provide fair comparison to  correlating/Gshare predictors.
